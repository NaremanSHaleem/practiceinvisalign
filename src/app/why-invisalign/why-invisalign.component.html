            <h2>Invisalign vs. Traditional Braces</h2>
        </div>

            <h3>Clear & Invisible</h3>
            <p>
                Very discreet, hardly noticeable braces with no metal. You can not have conversations with friends,
                family and colleagues without them even realising that you are wearing Invisalign aligners.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6  col-sm-6">
            <h3>Removable & Comfortable</h3>
            <p>
                Invisalign Aligners are removable which means you can brush, floss eat, drink or play sport with ease. The smooth plastic
                is easy on the mouth, and wonâ€™t irritate the gums or cheeks the way some brackets and wires might from traditional
                braces.
            </p>

        <div class="col-md-6  col-sm-6">
            <h3>Fewer Appointments</h3>
            <p>
                Appointments are far fewer than traditional braces, they are quick and convenient with no need for wire changes or bracket
                repositioning.
